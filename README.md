## IMCC Initial 6d Cooling using Rectilinear Channel Analysis ##
This is the repository that contains all work from Summer 2025 involving the development of a g4beamline simulation for the comparison of the initial cooling channel devised as the baseline by the International Muon Collider Collaboration in ICOOL. The aim is to develop tolerance analyses and design suggestions.

The progress over Summer 2025 for this project is logged daily at: https://tinyurl.com/incis-summer-progress
